**Energy Aware: Decentralised Aggregation Mechanisms in Federated Learning**   

This repository presents the implementation and experimental results of energy-efficient, decentralised
aggregation strategies in Federated Learning (FL) systems. The proposed framework reduces communication
overhead and energy consumption by using a graph-based topology and decentralised update mechanisms,
replacing traditional centralised server-based aggregation.

Energy-Aware Design: Minimises device power usage by adaptive client participation based on energy and performance trade-offs.
Decentralised Aggregation: Eliminates the need for a central server using peer-to-peer model exchanges.
Graph Topology: Clients are connected through dynamic directed graphs, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.
Simulation & Results: Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets demonstrating efficiency in accuracy vs. energy/performance metrics.
